# Introducing Voice Mirror

We're excited to announce the alpha release of **Voice Mirror** — a voice-controlled AI agent overlay that lives on your desktop.

## The Problem We're Solving

AI coding assistants are powerful, but they're trapped inside text boxes. You have to switch windows, copy-paste context, and type everything. What if your AI could just *hear* you, *see* your screen, and *act* on your computer?

## Our Approach: Eyes + Ears + Voice

Voice Mirror is a transparent desktop overlay that combines:

- **Voice Control** — Wake word activation, push-to-talk, or continuous conversation
- **Screen Awareness** — Captures your display and understands what you're looking at
- **Terminal Power** — Spawns Claude Code internally for real command execution
- **Browser Automation** — Full Chrome control via CDP
- **Persistent Memory** — Three-tier memory system across sessions
- **Voice Cloning** — Clone any voice from a 3-second audio clip

The result? **A full AI agent for your entire computer**, controlled entirely by voice.

## What's Included

Voice Mirror ships with 58 MCP tools across 8 groups, support for 75+ AI models via Claude Code, OpenCode, and Ollama, and a lightweight voice stack that runs entirely on CPU.

## Alpha Access

Voice Mirror is **free and open source**. We're looking for early adopters who want to push voice-controlled AI to the next level.

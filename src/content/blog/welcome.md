# Introducing Context Mirror

We're excited to announce the alpha release of **Context Mirror** — a VSCode extension that makes local LLMs punch above their weight.

## The Problem We're Solving

Local LLMs like Qwen 2.5 Coder and Devstral are fast, private, and free. But they struggle with real-world codebases. They don't understand project structure, forget context between sessions, and make the same mistakes repeatedly.

## Our Approach: Intelligent Scaffolding

Instead of training bigger models, we built smarter scaffolding. Context Mirror wraps your local LLM with:

- **Context Injection** — Your workspace decoded into an LLM-digestible format
- **Self-Learning** — Mistakes become lessons, patterns become skills
- **Persistent Memory** — Facts remembered across sessions
- **Hook Enforcement** — Policies that prevent common errors

The result? **A 14B model with Context Mirror outperforms a raw 70B model** on real coding tasks.

## What's Included

### Context Mirror (VSCode Extension)
The core product with 56 MCP tools, semantic search, and the full scaffolding system.

### Voice Mirror (Desktop Overlay)
A free companion product that adds voice control, screen awareness, and multi-AI provider support to your setup.

## Alpha Access

Context Mirror is **free during alpha**. We're looking for early adopters who want to push local AI coding to the next level.
